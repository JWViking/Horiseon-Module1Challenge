# Horiseon- Module 1 Challenge

## Description
This is a project created in a coding bootcamp practicing accessibility, CSS organization, and html semantic elements. This should be screen reader friendly. The CSS organization should flow in the order they are introduced in the HTML, and the semantic elements should be logical.
